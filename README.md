Setup
=====

You will the following python libraries: `scikit-learn`, `jupyter`,
`matplotlib`, `scikit-optimize`* and their dependencies.

To install `scikit-optimize` use:
```
$ pip install https://github.com/scikit-optimize/scikit-optimize/archive/1677188ee6de3365f7925de780dd2f31e5e34ee4.zip
```
This will install a particular snapshot of the library that is known to work.
